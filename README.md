# CS271 Binary Search Tree Implementation
Binary Search Tree implementation for CS271, data structures,
at Denison University by Khai Le and Joel Singh.

## Caveats

- The binary search tree can only handle data types of
`string`, `bool`, and `arithmetic` as they are the only ones
programmed with default values for `get` if the requested key,
`k`, is not in the tree.
